## Project Description

This project was developed as part of a Deep Learning course and focuses on multi-class image classification.

The dataset consists of 5 image classes and was collected and prepared by the students as part of the course project.

A ResNet-50 model was first implemented as a baseline using transfer learning.  
To further improve performance, an attention mechanism was added to the model, enhancing its ability to focus on the most relevant features in the images.

The enhanced model achieved improved classification accuracy compared to the baseline ResNet-50 model, demonstrating the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in deep learning-based image classification tasks.
